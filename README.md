# simpleMVCRouter
Simple MVC Router System

This was originally written for the mvc project I started, and then updated for the simple mvc project, which allowed 
the router to be able to mostly stand on its own and work. 

There are a few things that you will have to adjust to use this on your own project,

You'll need to remove lines from the Router->resolve() method and replace them with your own code (lines 98-136)
